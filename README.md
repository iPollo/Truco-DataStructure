# TrucoDS
A simple game made in C using Raylib inspired by the Truco gameplay. Truco is a card game played in various parts of South America and some regions of Spain and Italy. It is a trick-taking game played with a Spanish deck of cards by two, four or six players, divided into two opposing sides.

The objective was to implement various data structures in C to support gameplay functionality, including stacks, circular lists, singly linked lists, and doubly linked lists.

This is a project for the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS).<br/>
This project was written and compiled using [Raylib](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib).
